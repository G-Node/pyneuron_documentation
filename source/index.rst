Welcome to a documentation of pyNEURON
======================================

This is an introduction to use Python in order to

  * simulate single cell experiments,
  * organize your python code,
  * control your data with a SQL database,

with a little example project.

This tutorial was developed during my work for the `Advanced Course in
Computational Neuroscience` 2009 in Freiburg. Also, many ideas and suggestions
for this tutorial go back to the pyneuron workshop at the CNS, Berlin 2009. At
this point I have to thank Alvaro, Andrew, Eilif, Michele, Robert, and many
more people from the conference/workshop for fruitful discussions.
